        i'm currently building government digital services at <a class="color-fill--primary" href="https://adhocteam.us/">Ad Hoc</a>, where i've had the privilege of contributing to sites like Healthcare.gov, Vets.gov, and the design system for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. you can see some of my work live <a class="color-fill--primary" href="https://findlocalhelp.healthcare.gov">here</a>. previously, i worked at <a class="color-fill--primary" href="https://www.rga.com/">R/GA</a> in the prototype studio.

      i also help the folks at <a class="color-fill--primary" href="http://girldevelopit.com">Girl Develop It</a> organize events, and i occasionally teach classes. if it weren't for organizations like this, it would have been much more difficult for me to change my career path and build a network of successful women in tech.
